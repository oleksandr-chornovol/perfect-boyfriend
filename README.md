# Perfect Boyfriend

The main idea of the app is a Telegram bot that can send random compliments to the client.

There are CRUD endpoints to manage compliments.

Some compliments can be a greeting. For such compliments, there is a scheduler that sends greetings to all bot clients every day.

Some compliments may have appropriate weather, and this property can be taken into account when sending compliments. For example, when it's cloudy today, the bot can send something like:
> â€œGood morning, honey! It's a bit cloudy today, so instead of the sun, today will be your smile!".
